# power-bi-world-energy-consumption-dashboard
World energy consumption dashboard:


Objective: to analyze energy consumption dataset and gain insights by highlighting trends and patterns in total energy consumption, renewable energy consumption etc.


Tools: Power BI, power query



What I did:

⦁	cleaned dataset by removing unnecessary columns and data
⦁	created new calculated columns and measures such as energy intensity, greenhouse reduction%, year over year energy growth etc using dax formulas
⦁	built interactive dashboard visualizing yoy energy growth by country, energy intensity by country, trend in greenhouse reduction% over years etc.
⦁	utilized drill-through method to navigate from the summary page to a detailed page




Key insights:

⦁	China is the top greenhouse gas emitting country
⦁	Iceland is the top consumer for renewable energy
⦁	greenhouse gas reduction was maximum in the year 2010
⦁	fossil fuel is the most consumed fuel type
